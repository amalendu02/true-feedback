# 🚀 True Feedback – Anonymous Messaging Platform

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In many environments—educational, personal, or corporate—people hesitate to share honest feedback due to fear of judgment or exposure. Most platforms require sender registration or compromise anonymity. **True Feedback** solves this by enabling users to receive messages via unique links without needing to know the sender, ensuring complete anonymity and privacy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, React Hook Form  
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, MongoDB with Mongoose, Zod for validation  
- **Authentication**: NextAuth/Auth.js with Email OTP  
- **Email Service**: Resend (for sending OTPs)  
- **Validation & Testing**: Zod, Postman  
- **Extras**: Debouncing, Aggregation Pipeline, Carousel, AI Features (Experimental)

## ⚙️ Challenging Parts

- Implementing secure **OTP-based login** and **unique username checks** using Auth.js and MongoDB.
- Designing clean, accessible UI components with **Shadcn/ui** while handling edge cases and form validations.
- Building a flexible **message aggregation system** using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline.
- Managing complex state and UI updates across components like **carousel**, **dashboards**, and **OTP forms**.

## 🔁 Project Workflow & Logic

1. **User Signup/Login**: Users sign up with their email. OTP is sent via **Resend** and verified with **NextAuth**.
2. **Unique Link Generation**: After verification, each user gets a unique ID or link to receive messages.
3. **Anonymous Message Sending**: Anyone can send messages through this link **without login or identity**.
4. **Dashboard View**: Logged-in users can view received messages on their **personal dashboard**.
5. **Validation & Error Handling**: Input fields are validated with **Zod**, and forms are built with **React Hook Form**.
6. **Additional Features**: AI integration (optional), Carousel UI, and real-time debounced username checks.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add optional login for anonymous message senders for richer message context.
- Implement spam protection and rate limiting to avoid abuse.
- Enable message replies while maintaining anonymity.
- Add analytics/dashboard to track message trends or sentiment.
- Improve mobile UI/UX and animation experience with Framer Motion or Shadcn extensions.
